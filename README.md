## üöÄ Constructors and Destructors in C++

### **üìò Overview**
<p>
In C++, <strong>constructors</strong> and <strong>destructors</strong> are special member functions that play a crucial role in object-oriented programming. They manage the initialization and cleanup of objects in a class, ensuring that resources are allocated and released properly.
</p>

### **üõ†Ô∏è Constructors**
<p>
A <strong>constructor</strong> is a special member function that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's data members.
</p>

#### **Syntax:**
<pre><code>class ClassName {
public:
    ClassName() {
        // Constructor code
    }
};
</code></pre>

#### **Types of Constructors:**

1. **Default Constructor**:
   <p>A constructor that does not take any arguments.</p>
   <pre><code>ClassName() {
       // Default constructor code
   }
   </code></pre>
   <br>

2. **Parameterized Constructor**:
   <p>A constructor that takes parameters to initialize the object's data members with specific values.</p>
   <pre><code>ClassName(int x, int y) {
       // Parameterized constructor code
   }
   </code></pre>
   <br>

3. **Copy Constructor**:
   <p>A constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.</p>
   <pre><code>ClassName(const ClassName &obj) {
       // Copy constructor code
   }
   </code></pre>
   <br>

### **üîÑ Destructors**
<p>
A <strong>destructor</strong> is a special member function that is automatically called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Its main purpose is to release resources allocated by the constructor or during the object's lifetime.
</p>

#### **Syntax:**
<pre><code>class ClassName {
public:
    ~ClassName() {
        // Destructor code
    }
};
</code></pre>

#### **Key Points:**
<ul>
<li>The destructor has the same name as the class, but it is preceded by a tilde (~).</li>
<li>Unlike constructors, a class can only have one destructor.</li>
<li>Destructors cannot be overloaded, take arguments, or return values.</li>
</ul>

### **üîç Conclusion**
<p>
Constructors initialize an object when it is created, while destructors clean up before the object is destroyed. C++ allows for different types of constructors to handle various object creation scenarios. Understanding constructors and destructors is key to managing resources efficiently in C++.
